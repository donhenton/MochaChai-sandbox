# UPDATING TO NEW BABEL


Updates include the new syntax for running babel preprocessor in mocha. See the 
package.json unittests and unitcoverage scripts.

The sample test and src are using ES6 class syntax, and won't work out of the
box since th references are incorrect. It should be possible to get these get
these to work eventually

npm run <script> is used here to launch tests

the dependencies aren't important, its the devDependencies that are relevant
to testing
